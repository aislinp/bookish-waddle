    <h1>How it all works</h1>
    <p>Our application utilizes the <a href = https://datahub.io/core/co2-ppm-daily#python >“CO2 PPM - Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide”</a> dataset published by <a href=https://datahub.io/core>core</a>, and extracts data about the parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Senate Stalker compares the current date’s atmospheric CO2 level to that of the previous year on the same date, and calculates the increase in CO2 levels. The Senate Stalker then uses the Twitter API and, across the first four weeks of every month, will automatically tag and personally tweet each senator who voted against the Green New Deal resolutions with a helpful reminder of the increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, with the goal that these senators will eventually take action to address the climate crisis as it becomes more and more dire.</p>
